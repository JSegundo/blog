### A space for collecting the dots

"Creative research is all about collecting the dots. It‚Äôs more common to think of ‚Äúconnecting the dots‚Äù but the truth is that you can‚Äôt connect the dots you can‚Äôt see. And we can only hold a tiny number of things in our brains at once. So a space for collecting (and organizing) the dots is a crucial foundation for thinking, creativity and more"
