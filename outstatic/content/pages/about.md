## Hey, I'm Segundo! 👋

⚙️ Front-end developer \
🇦🇷 From Argentina ️, now based in Barcelona 🇪🇸

Having gained experience from two professional roles as dev, with the last one ending due to the closure of the startup I was working for, I've embraced a learning-focused mindset

Right now, I'm immersing myself in open source projects, and following a Blog Driven Development approach to document, and learn as I blog.

### Tech I use 🎛️

```js
React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, Node.js, Docker, Git, AWS, Jest, Vitest, MongoDB, MySQL, React Native, Figma ...
```
