i started hearing this term a while ago and ive been trying but struggling to really understand it. Right now is undeniably the future of react applications and a must know for developers.

the things we all first hear, is that you can now render a component in the server, so you avoid expensive render in the client, making a better user experience and SEO.

but this is a drastic change to how we were structuring our react applicactions in the past.

This will be a list of the things that helped me (are helping) make the 'click', the 'aha' moment with this topic.

The goal is to understand what really happens, the pros and downfalls of it, and how to think about data fetching and state managment
