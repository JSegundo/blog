last week i had a talk with two different types of people; an experienced software engineer, **skeptical about AI IDEs like cursor, and on the other hand, a total vibe-coder, making money by doing some projects totally vibe coding it, with no real understanding of software.**

**the first one complained about not trusting an LLM to modify his code, it can make mistakes and screw everything up (I don't disagree). The second admitted prompting the IDE with 'do this', 'fix that' and not having a clue about what the generated code is doing.**

naturally, i saw myself explaining them how I use these amazing tools in my favor, to improve my productivity without generating mass-trash code. I then came up with a list of steps that i follow, that i havenâ€™t really thought about. i came there naturally. to then realize that is a standard while watching at Ed Donner AI Agents course.

first thing is you should never put your hands on the fire for the LLM. doubt everything. not always the first solution proposed will be the proper one for your problem.

- when approaching complex tasks such as a feature implementation / big refactor, ask to break it into tasks. 


- ask to generate MD documents about implementation plans, whats been implemented already, and guidelines / folder structure, etc. you can later feed other chats with this docs as context.
- get at least 3 possible solutions for your problem. then ask the llm to compare them considering whats important in your project. (if you follow some specific architecture,  design patterns.. or simply to always aim to follow SOLID principles, you can end up with repeated logic trough your codebase)
