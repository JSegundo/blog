Random notes from basic learnings;

- Foundation models are the basis of every generative AI model and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or fields

  - eg: NPL: CHATBOTS
  - Computer Vision: Image generation (e.g., DALL·E)

- There are diff types of foundation models: (There are a lot more)

  - LLMs
  - DIffusion Models:
    - They generate data that is similar to the data they’ve been trained on.
