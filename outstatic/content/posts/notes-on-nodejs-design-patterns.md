I now see Node as a **fancy interface**. Since I learned that one of its few principles is having the smallers possible set of functionalities, leaving the rest to the ecosystem of modules living outside the code.

The concept of **module** is fundamental in Node for structuring the code of a program. Designing small modules and packages is one of the most evangelized principles. It comes from two principles of the Unix philosophy:

- "Small is beautiful."
- "Make each program do one thing well."

Node.js modules is the fact that they are created to be used, rather than extended.
