As a frontend developer coming from a bootcamp, i was sure i knew everything one should know about JavaScript to move on onto React or any other framework.

variable declaration, loops, if statements, some DOM manipilation, object methods (forEach, Map), and a bit of the weird things like clousures, hoisting and the 'this' keyword.

I saw it as a checklist of things to know but i couldnt wait to jump into React and start building stuff.

After working on multiple projects and websites with React, one notices a lack of knowledge, and starts wondering .. why ?

days ago i was working on a personal weather app to sthrengten my skills. i wanted to achieve a solid, well funded state managment of my application.

my go-to was always redux. i asked myself why redux? why not a javascript variable in window object? whats the purpose of redux?

in this post im going to try to come up with a simple list of things that react solves for building web apps.

here is a nice quote:

> React allows you to write maintainable and performant code by using the concept of components. Components allow you to focus on describing the UI you want, rather than focusing on the details of how the UI actually gets inserted in the page.
